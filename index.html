                            Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their<br>
                            first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. Most people <br>
                            do know when their birthdays are, but some might not know what day of the week they were born.<br>
                            Akan Name Application helps users get their name by providing their gender and date of birth.  <br>

                            This project involved the development of a web application to aid in the tracking <br>
                            of radiation detectors (devices). I was awarded this project by a client and delivered <br>
                            it in time. I never icluded code here since it is supposed to be confidential.
